Written Report for Pandas-Challenge

Summary
-------
This analysis provides a list of comprehensive summaries for all the key metrics in the given school district.
Starting with an overall summarization and from there, breaking it down into more specific categories, 
such as spending, grade averages and total student body count per school and/or school type.

Conclusions
-----------
One conclusion that can be made is that there isn't any drastic change in math/reading scores between grades
in any of the given schools. I would've expected at least a slight increase with each new grade but for the most
part the scores stay almost the same, and in some cases even decrease slightly.

another conclusion that can be made is that there is very big difference in scoring/passing percentages between
spending ranges (per student). All the highest scores tend to come from the schools that have the lowest budgets.
